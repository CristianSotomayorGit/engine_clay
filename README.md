This library is a BIM geometry kernel and modeller built on top of [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/). It's specifically designed to create BIM applications that require the generation / edition of geometries and/or to expose 3D modellers to end users.

It's a work in progress and the API might be unstable.
